# FIFO-buffer-RTL-Simulation
This repository contains the Register Transfer Level (RTL) design and simulation of a FIFO (First-In First-Out) buffer implemented in Verilog. The FIFO acts as a data queue, where the first data written is the first to be read, making it ideal for buffering and streaming applications in digital systems.
